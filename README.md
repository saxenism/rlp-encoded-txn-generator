# RLP Encoded Transaction Generator

This tool is a wrapper on web3.js used to generate sample (mock) RLP encoded transactions. Will be helpful in testing functions which take RLP encoded transactions
as inputs.

The number of tranasactions you want must be passed as a command line argument.

A file consisting of the transactions will be created called `transactions-example-file.json`.

The filed `rawTransaction` is the RLP encoded transaction.
